# To find the longest common prefix of a list of strings,
# we can iterate through the characters of the first string
# and compare them with the corresponding characters of the
# other strings. If any character doesn't match or we reach
# the end of any string, we can return the prefix found so far.

def longest_common_prefix(strings):
    if not strings:
        return ""
    
    for i, char in enumerate(strings[0]):
        for string in strings[1:]:
            if i >= len(string) or string[i] != char:
                return strings[0][:i]
    
    return strings[0]

# Example usage:
strings = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
print(longest_common_prefix(strings))
# Output: "fl"

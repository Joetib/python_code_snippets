# To execute a raw SQL query in Django, we can use the
# 'raw' method on the model's manager
# Ensure to import the model and connection
from myapp.models import MyModel
from django.db import connection

# Write your SQL query
query = "SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE condition = %s"

# Execute the query
results = MyModel.objects.raw(query, [condition_value])

# Access the results
for result in results:
    print(result.field_name)

# Note: Replace 'myapp', 'MyModel', 'my_table', 'condition',
# 'condition_value', and 'field_name' with actual values

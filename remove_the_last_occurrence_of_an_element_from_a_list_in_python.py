# To remove the last occurrence of an element from a list in Python,
# we can use the reverse() method to reverse the list and then use the remove() method to remove the first occurrence of the element.
# Finally, we can reverse the list again to get the original order.

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6, 3]
element = 3

my_list.reverse()
my_list.remove(element)
my_list.reverse()

print(my_list)

# Output:
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

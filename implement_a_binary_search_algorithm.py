# Binary search algorithm implementation
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid

# Example usage
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
target = 12
result = binary_search(arr, target)
print(f"Element {target} found at index {result}")
# Output
# >> Element 12 found at index 5

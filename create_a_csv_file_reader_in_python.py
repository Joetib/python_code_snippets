# To read a CSV file in Python, we can use the built-in `csv` module.
# Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to read a CSV file:

import csv

# Open the CSV file in read mode
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    # Create a CSV reader object
    reader = csv.reader(file)

    # Iterate over each row in the CSV file
    for row in reader:
        # Access each column in the row
        for column in row:
            # Print the value of each column
            print(column)

# Output:
# Value1
# Value2
# Value3
# ...

# Make sure to replace 'data.csv' with the actual path to your CSV file.
# The code above reads the CSV file row by row and prints the value of each column.
# You can modify the code to perform any desired operations on the CSV data.
